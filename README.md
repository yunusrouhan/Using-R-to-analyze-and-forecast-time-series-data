Using R to forecast the weekly total sales, for all stores, for four weeks ahead.

The data set contains the weekly sales per department per store for a chain of supermarket stores.

The variable IsHoliday denotes if it was a holiday or not.

Because I am working with time-series data here, I used ARIMA model to forecast the weekly total sales, for all stores, for four weeks ahead.
